# Canvas+ Emoji Guide
It's very helpful to have commit messages with emojis. People viewing or working on the extension can easily see what a commit is about with emojis. Obviously you don't have to use emojis in commit messages, but I recommend it, and if you do use emojis, I ask that you use this format.

Based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/), tailored for Canvas+

|Commit type|Emoji|
|:-|:-|
|New feature|:sparkles: `:sparkles:`|
|Improve feature|:zap: `:zap:`
|Bugfix|:bug: `:bug:`|
|Improve code structure|:art: `:art:`|
|Improve performance|:racehorse: `:racehorse:`|
|Hotfix|:ambulance: `:ambulance:`|
|Documentation|:books: `:books:`|
|Edit popup|:gear: `:gear:`|
|Edit color modes|:lipstick: `:lipstick:`|
|Add website content|:pencil2: `:pencil2`|
|Change backend jekyll|:test_tube: `:test_tube:`|
|Release|:ribbon: `:ribbon`|
|Something else|Be creative!|

### Add an extra emoji to non-chrome browsers:
If a commit makes changes to another browser, add a second emoji. If you're editing multiple browsers, you can put multiple. If you're editing multiple browsers **including chrome**, no need to use an emoji. I'd recommend seperating commits by browsers, though.

|Browser|Emoji|
|:-|:-
|Firefox|:fox_face: `:fox_face:`|
|Safari|:compass: `:compass:`|
|Edge|:ocean: `:ocean:`|
|Opera|:musical_note: `:musical_note:`|
|Opera GX|:notes: `:notes:`|
|Brave|:lion: `:lion:`|
