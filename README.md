<h3 align="center">What we're working on</h3>
<br>

Hey curious Canvas+ user! We believe transparency is key to a great product, so in addition being open-source, we're outgoing about what we're working on next. We've always found the search bar to be one of the most helpful features for daily use, but a search bar doesn't work for everything. Think about it. There's a reason your file explorer isn't just a search bar, which is why we're overhauling our search engine and adding a new way to search: navigator.
<br>

As the Canvas team is redesigning many important pages in the user interface, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a good place to put the search bar. To solve this, we're moving the search bar on top of the UI, something more convenient for everyone. All the links and buttons will be bigger, and optimized for speedy keyboard navigation. Lastly, the search algorithm is getting smart. It'll use advanced features to get what you're looking for, like spellcheck, special character awareness, and context clues.
<br>

For that page that search just isn't designed for, navigator is the perfect way to find it, and it's built right into the new search. Just press `SLASH` to open the navigator. Let's say you want to find something in a certain module, and you're on your dashboard. Without navigator, you'd have to go the course, then go the its modules, and finally look for the item. The time you spend waiting for pages to load adds up, and navigator aims to fix this. Instead of loading all the unnecessary content of each page like images and scripts, navigator caches API requests to make your search truly feel like a file explorer.
